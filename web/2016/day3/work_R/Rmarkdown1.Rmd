The sine of $\pi/2$ is `r round(sin(pi/2),)`

Let's write some code to generate random normals and draw a histogram.
```{r Normal}
x=rnorm(1000, mean=2, sd=3)
hist(x, main="N(2,9)", xlab="Ransom Numbers", nclass=50)
```

Generate the phenotypic scores as 20 random normals. Call this vector pheno.
```{r phenotype}
pheno=rnorm(20)
hist(pheno, nclass=20)
```

generate gene expression matrix
```{r genes}
genes=matrix(rnorm(1000*20), nrow=1000, ncol=20)
genes[1:5]
```

correlations between gene expression and phenotypes and plot the correlations
```{r correlations}
x=t(genes)
cors=cor(x, pheno)
hist(cors)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r sessionInformation}
sessionInfo()
```
